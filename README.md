# Obsidian Link Externalizer

A plugin for Obsidian that converts internal links to external URLs based on frontmatter information, making your notes more portable and shareable outside of Obsidian.

## Features

- **URL Conversion**: Automatically converts internal links to external URLs if the referenced note has a URL specified in its frontmatter
- **Fallback Behavior**: Removes internal links if no URL is specified in the target note's frontmatter
- **Multiple Link Format Support**: Works with both Markdown links and Wiki-style links
- **Link Processing Options**: Supports both full document processing and selection-based processing

## Example

This plugin processes links in your current note by checking the frontmatter of referenced notes.

### Referenced Notes


1. Note with URL:
```md
---
title: obsidian
url: https://obsidian.md/
---
Local note about Obsidian
```

2. Note without URL:
```md
---
title: another-note
url:
---
Local note without url
```


### Link Conversion Example

Before:
```md
---
title: My Notes
---
Obsidian is a great note-taking app! 
Learn more about [[obsidian]].

You can also use it for [[another-note]] which has no URL in frontmatter.
```

After:
```md
---
title: My Notes
---
Obsidian is a great note-taking app! 
Learn more about [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

You can also use it for another-note which has no URL in frontmatter.
```

### Conversion Rules

- Links to notes with a URL → Converted to external links
- Links to notes without a URL → Link is removed, leaving only the text
